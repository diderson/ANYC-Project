                      	The ANC is committed to ensuring that its public representatives are continuously reviewed & assessed to ensure that its representatives are equipped with the required tools to meet the challenges of the people of South Africa.</p>
<p>
This assessment process is one such exercise to allow the organization a diagnostic review of the performance and challenges faced by its public representatives. It will assist the ANC going forward on how better we equip and capacitate its public representatives in meeting the challenges faced by our country and its people.</p>

This assessment is an internal process of the organization and will aid the leadership is designing better systems for its future public representatives. This assessment is part of a series of monitoring and evaluation interventions by the ANC to better understand the challenges it faces, but more important, to review its implementation of policy guidelines of the ANC in government and the state in general.
